# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction with Random Forest  

This repository contains a Machine Learning project focused on **predicting customer churn** — identifying whether a customer will stay or leave.  
The prediction model is built using a **Random Forest Classifier** as part of my learning journey in ML.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Customer churn is a significant challenge in industries like telecom, banking, and subscription-driven services.  
Accurate churn prediction allows businesses to take preventive actions and improve customer retention.  

Steps in this project:  
- Applied **data preprocessing** (missing values handled, categorical encoding, feature scaling).  
- Built and trained a **Random Forest classifier**.  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix**.  
- Leveraged **SHAP values** for explainability and feature impact analysis.

## 📂 Key Features  
- Random Forest model for churn classification  
- Performance evaluation using multiple metrics  
- Confusion Matrix visualization for detailed insights  
- SHAP summary plots for model interpretability  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Model achieved an accuracy of about **79%** on the test dataset  
- Key influencing factors: **tenure, contract type, payment method**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Google Colab environment)  
- **Scikit-learn** – model building and evaluation  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data preprocessing and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **SHAP** – feature importance and explainability  

---

## 📌 How to Run  
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**  
2. Upload your dataset (`.csv` file)  
3. Execute all cells to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model
